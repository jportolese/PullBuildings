# PullBuildings
This jupyter notebook pulls buildings based on a drawn area of interest from the BING building footprint repository

When drawing the AOI keep in mind that a large area will take some time to download the buildings.  I recommend a small area that doesn't span too many tiles of the BING data in the later step

Output will be written in geojson format in the directory you ran the notebook in and it will be called Footprints.geojson
